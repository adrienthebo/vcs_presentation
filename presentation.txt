# Introduction

## What is Version Control?

  * A Version Control System, or VCS, is a tool used to track changes to files
  * Allows you to manage code or documents as you work
    * Make changes in incremental steps
    * View changes
    * Revert errors
  * Greatly simplifies collaboration

## Why Should You Care?

  * Try out experimental ideas without destroying your code base
  * Resolve mistakes by switching to the last working copy
  * Find the change that introduced a bug
  * Have VCS merge your changes with classmates instead of by hand
  * Use VCS as a backup system!
    * "Wait, you **didn't** want that file deleted?"

## Why Should You Care?

  * Any sane developer uses VCS
    * Github
    * Gitorious
    * Mercurial
    * code.google.com
    * Sourceforge
    * et cetera...
  * Version control systems are the life blood of open source
    * Reduces barrier to entry
    * Easier to manage contributions

## Why Should You Care?

  * Managing data and code is hard
  * Collaborating with other people is even harder
  * Version control tools are designed to make this as seamless as possible.

# Background

## Before VCS

Living dangerously!

    nano really_complex_algorithm.c

*three hours later:*

    rm -rf *

Whoops.

## Do It Yourself VCS

Early implementations of version control was done by copying files

    nano really_complex_algorithm.c
    cp really_complex_algorithm.c really_complex_algorithm.c.1
    nano really_complex_algorithm.c
    cp really_complex_algorithm.c really_complex_algorithm.c.2
    nano really_complex_algorithm.c
    cp really_complex_algorithm.c really_complex_algorithm.c.3

This wouldn't get tedious at all!

## The beginning of VCS

  * Initial idea of VCS came from engineering
  * Engineers would create blueprints, and save earlier revisions
  * If a version was not liked, it was trivial to roll back
  * Revision control was also applied in business, law
  * Any place where you may need to backtrack on a document, VCS will show up

## Requirements for VCS

  * Any VCS has to deal with some basic concerns
    * Merging changes
    * Locking files
    * Atomic commits
  * Each VCS handles these concerns differently

!SLIDE

# A Tour of Version Control Systems

## Source Code Control System (SCCS)

  * Arguably the first VCS system available
  * Developed by Bell Labs in 1972
    * For some comparison, C was written in 1972 at Bell Labs as well
  * SCCS was the dominant VCS until the advent of RCS
  * Generally considered obsolete, and only mentioned for historical purposes
  * Except for the storage method - still used today

[Wikipedia: Source Code Control System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System)

## Revision Control System (RCS)

  * Revision Control System (RCS)
    * Released in 1982
    * Created as an evolution of SCCS
    * Stored changes of files as a series of diffs
    * Very popular, still used today

[Wikipedia: Revision Control System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System)

## Pros and Cons of RCS

  * Advantages
    * Dirt simple
    * Only need to know a few commands
    * Changesets stored as a series of diffs, so easy to view
    * File locking and branching supported
  * Disadvantages
    * Single files only
    * Cannot store entire projects
    * No security mechanisms - anyone can tamper with diffs
    * Branching sucks - everybody just locks the file

## RCS in action

    co -l agenda.txt <-- check out and lock a file
    nano agenda.txt
    ci -u agenda.txt <-- check in and unlock a file

!SLIDE

# Centralized VCS

## Modern VCS

  * While early VCS systems were important, they were still lacking
  * No real support for multiple users
  * No support for project-wide version control
  * Make changes in foo.c and bar.c, and changes in one break the other
  * No way to look at both of the changes without black magic and/or shell scripts
  * Technologies started coming out to deal with this

## Concurrent Version System (CVS)

  * Behold! Another evolution!
  * CVS was the first client-server VCS
  * Built upon RCS
  * Tracks a set of files, or a project
  * Instead of just hacking on one file in a specific location, you check out a project
  * Support for multiple users simultaneously working on one project

## Applications of CVS Today

  * While CVS is largely obsolete, a few projects still use it today
  * Examples:
    * Gentoo - portage
    * FreeBSD - ports
    * Various open source projects

## Pros and Cons of CVS

  * Advantages
    * ...
    * ...
    * CVS was used because it was the first, not because it was good.
  * Disadvantages
    * No moving/renaming of directories
    * No versioning of symbolic links
    * No unicode
    * No atomic commits
      * If a commit fails halfway through, the project might be inconsistent
      * It'll commit enough changes to break everything!
    * Et cetera

!SLIDE

# SVN

## Apache Subversion (SVN)

  * Since CVS sucked so much, people wanted an alternative
  * SVN was designed as CVS without the problems
  * Widely adopted by the open source community
  * Support for a wide number of features

## Features of SVN

  * Support for Properties
    * On the fly keywording in the source - note the last changed date in a comment
    * Store mime-types
    * Store executable bit (*nix)
  * Sane branching
  * Support for authentication/authorization
  * Atomic commits
  * Sane file locking

## SVN Terms

  * **trunk**
  * **branches**
  * **tags**

TODO

## Example SVN Structure

![svn](./images/svn/Subversion_project_visualization.png)

## Pros and Cons of SVN

  * Advantages
    * The most widely used VCS today
    * Robust and battle-tested
    * Fully centralized - collaboration is very easy
    * Support for branching and tagging
  * Disadvantages
    * Fully centralized - no offline work
    * Slow - network latency can increase time to work
      * Branches are heavyweight
        * Branching and tagging means making a full copy of all files
      * Directly correlated, merging is a massive operation
    * Based on CVS

!SLIDE

# Decentralized VCS

## Decentralized VCS

  * Centralized VCS has many limitations
    * No offline work
    * Forking a project is not trivial
    * Centralized model is not always the best for a project
  * People started experimenting with a decentralized model

## DVCS compared to CVCS

### Differences

  * All working copies are branches (no trunk)
  * Most actions operate on a local copy of the project
  * A central repository can exist, but is not required

### Advantages

  * Easy to fork and merge code
  * Network connectivity is not required to use DVCS
  * Resistant to failure

### Disadvantages

  * Initial clone is costly, as it copies the entire repo
  * Added complexity
    * Ordering commits becomes much less straightforward

## Popular DVCS Tools

  1. Git
  2. Mercurial
  3. Arch
  4. Darcs
  5. Bazaar

  * Git and Mercurial are the heavyweights of the field
  * Others are used but on a smaller scale

# Git

## Introduction to Git


> I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now git.
>
> *Linus Torvalds*

  * Git is the most popular of all the DVCS tools
  * Open source DVCS created by Linux Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel
  * Created to fill the gap left by a previous proprietary DVCS
  * The result of letting kernel hackers write a DVCS

## The inspiration for Git

  * Git is a remarkable tool that had to fulfill a difficult set of obligations
  * Track the entire kernel history, with incredible amounts of information
  * Needed to be small, fast, and powerful

> Take CVS as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision.

## Characteristics of Git

  * Designed for nonlinear development (Think kernel development)
  * Built for distributed and offline work
  * Built for speed and ability to handle large projects
  * Cryptographic authentication/verification

# Single Player Git

## Git - Creating a Project

    adrien@dre:~$ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /private/vcs_presentation/.git/

This creates a new project in the current directory.

    adrien@dre:~$ ls -la
    total 264
    drwx------  13 adrien  admin    442 Feb 24 17:52 ./
    drwx------   9 adrien  admin    306 Feb 23 22:41 ../
    drwx------  15 adrien  admin    510 Feb 24 17:52 .git/ <--- git init creates this directory

## Git - adding a file

    git add lib/vunderbeam.rb

  * This takes a snapshot of the vunderbeam file and adds it to the **index**

## Git - seeing the project status

    % git status
    # On branch master
    # Changes to be committed:
    #   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
    #
    #	new file:   lib/vunderbeam.rb

## Git - seeing what content changed

    adrien@dre:~$ git diff lib/vunderbeam
    diff --git a/lib/vunderbeam.rb b/lib/vunderbeam.rb
    index 7042555..48ce445 100644

## Git - making your changes permanent

    adrien@dre:~$ git commit -m 'Check out my awesome commit!'
    [master (root-commit) 6735123] Check out my awesome commit!
     1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

  * With git, commit early and commit often
  * It's easier to make lots of small commits and tidy up later rather than
    split up big hunks of work

## Git - Looking at current branches

    adrien@dre:~$ cd src/facter
    adrien@dre:~$ git branch
    * 1.6.x
      external_fact_support_full
      master
      proto/master/docstrings
      ticket/1.6.x/12813-redirect_lspci_stderr
      ticket/11660-sshfp_and_ssh_rspec
      ticket/master/2157-external_fact_support
      ticket/master/4561-add_structured_data

  * I'm currently on the 1.6.x branch.
  * The 'master' branch is the default branch.
  * The ticket/(thing) branches are *feature* branches

## Git - Making a new branch

    adrien@dre:~$ git branch new_feature_branch

This creates the branch 'new_feature_branch'

    adrien@dre:~$ git branch
    * 1.6.x
      external_fact_support_full
      master
      new_feature_branch  <------ We made a new branch!
      proto/master/docstrings
      ticket/1.6.x/12813-redirect_lspci_stderr
      ticket/11660-sshfp_and_ssh_rspec
      ticket/master/2157-external_fact_support
      ticket/master/4561-add_structured_data

Note that we're still on the 1.6.x branch

## Git - Making a new branch

Alternately...

    adrien@dre:~$ git checkout -b another_feature_branch
    Switched to a new branch 'another_feature_branch'

This creates a new branch and switches to it.

    adrien@dre:~$ git branch
      1.6.x
    * another_feature_branch  <---- Another new branch! Note the asterisk!
      external_fact_support_full
      master
      new_feature_branch
      proto/master/docstrings
      ticket/1.6.x/12813-redirect_lspci_stderr
      ticket/11660-sshfp_and_ssh_rspec
      ticket/master/2157-external_fact_support
      ticket/master/4561-add_structured_data

The asterisk indicates that this is our current branch.

## Git - Working in a branch

  * When working in a branch, you would work as you would normally
  * This time, you have two different versions of history
  * Keep different tasks isolated

## Git - Merging a branch

In this example, I'll merge the branch 'duplicity' into the main branch,
'master'.

    adrien@dre:~$ git branch
    * duplicity
      ganeti
      master
    adrien@dre:~$ git checkout master
    Switched to branch 'master'
    % git merge duplicity
    Merge made by recursive.
     dist/duplicity/manifests/cron.pp |   70 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++-----
     1 files changed, 60 insertions(+), 10 deletions(-)

The resulting history looks like this:

    *   413e4a7 Adrien Thebo 3 minutes ago Merge branch 'duplicity'
    |\
    | * d6b7efc Adrien Thebo 3 hours ago Force removal of stale backup files
    | * 39d6423 Adrien Thebo 4 hours ago Echo date to duplicity last run file instead of touching
    | * 14f7e30 Adrien Thebo 4 hours ago Remove unneeded inline_template from duplicity::cron
    | * affa757 Adrien Thebo 4 hours ago Add incremental, full backups + cleanups for duplicity
    |/
    * f83a636 Adrien Thebo 5 hours ago Typo in duplicity for gpg agent info

## Git - Why Would You Use Branches?

  * Branches are incredibly powerful
  * They allow you to isolate different tasks
  * Do normal development on master
  * Try experimental ideas in a branch

Many projects require features be implemented in a branch

  * Makes integrating features easier
  * Work on big features without interfering with normal operations

# Multiplayer Git with Github

## Github - Copying a project as read-only

  * When cloning a project as readonly, use `git://`
  * EG: **git://**github.com/adrienthebo/worstprogramever

<pre>
    adrien@dre:~$ git clone git://github.com/adrienthebo/worstprogramever
    Cloning into worstprogramever...
    remote: Counting objects: 20, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (19/19), done.
    remote: Total 20 (delta 5), reused 9 (delta 1)
    Receiving objects: 100% (20/20), done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (5/5), done.
</pre>

## Github - Copying a project as read-write

  * When cloning a project as read-write, use `git@`
  * EG: **git@**github.com/adrienthebo/worstprogramever

<pre>
    adrien@dre:~$ git clone git@github.com:adrienthebo/worstprogramever
    Cloning into worstprogramever...
    remote: Counting objects: 20, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (19/19), done.

    Receiving objects: 100% (20/20), done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (5/5), done.
</pre>

## Github - Making changes to a project

### Make your changes as normal...

    adrien@dre:~$ nano README.markdown
    adrien@dre:~$ git add README.markdown
    adrien@dre:~$ git status
    ## master
    A  README.markdown
    adrien@dre:~$ git ci
    [master 3534eef] Added a README!
     1 files changed, 25 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
     create mode 100644 README.markdown

### And then run `git push`

    adrien@dre:~$ git push
    Counting objects: 4, done.
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 605 bytes, done.
    Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@github.com:adrienthebo/worstprogramever
       29e5bcd..3534eef  master -> master

This uploads your branch to the remote server, so you can share it with people.

# Git internals

## Git internals

No one part of git is especially complicated.

Too bad there are so many parts...

**WARNING**

This stuff is complex, and isn't necessary to get up and running. Don't worry
if it isn't immediately clear.

## Implementation

  * Initially written as a "content addressable filesystem"
  * Simply put, you put stuff in it, and you get a key to retrieve data
  * You fetch that key, you get that data
  * Eventually a full set of utilities were written to interact with git
  * Has types of blob, tree, commit, and tag
  * Objects are identified by a SHA-1 hash

## Why hash everything?

  * Using hashes to identify parts of git repository may seem bizarre, but it adds a lot to git
  * Hashes ensure that nobody can tamper with any part of the repository without changing hashes
  * Allows for extremely fast retrieval of files
    * Instead of searching a series of files for some content, you look for a specific filename
    * Instead of slowing down git, using hashes speeds it up

!SLIDE

# The building blocks of Git

## Blob

  * A "blob" is used to store file data - it is generally a file
  * Only contains the contents of a file
  * No attributes like the file name are stored

![Blob](./images/git/object-blob.png)

## Tree

  * A "tree" is basically like a directory
  * It references a bunch of other trees and/or blobs (i.e. files and sub-directories)
  * Trees store the metadata for the objects they point to, e.g. name, permissions, and content type

 ![Tree](./images/git/object-tree.png)

## Commit

  * A "commit" points to a single tree, marking it as what the project looked like at a certain point in time.
  * Has the following components:
    * tree: The hash of a tree object that shows that the project looks like at the time of the commit
    * parent: the hash of the preceding commit, or commits
    * author: the person who actually created the content
    * committer: the person who made the actual commit
    * comment: a description of the commit

![Commit](./images/git/object-commit.png)

## Tag

  * A tag is used to "annotate" a particular object
  * Commonly used to designate a specific commit, for things such as releases

![Tag](./images/git/object-tag.png)

## Putting it all together

![Objects](./images/git/objects-example.png)

!SLIDE

# Git concepts

## The working directory

  * The the directory containing your files in git is called the "working directory"
  * Any changes made to these are applied to the current branch
  * Nothing is absolute until you perform a git operation on it
  * Effectively a scratch space

## References

  * References are a way to track objects that are noteworthy
  * Simply a file containing a SHA1 hash
  * Lightweight tags are basically a reference and a tag object

## The index

  * The index, or staging area, is where you accumulate changes before a commit
  * This allows you to very carefully assemble commits
  * This is in contrast to SVN, where performing a commit adds all changes

!SLIDE

# Git workflow and commands

## Git workflow

![Workflow](./images/git/git-workflow.png)

## Changing files with git

  * `git init` - Creates a git repository in the current working disrectory
  * `git add` - Adds the specified file to the index
  * `git rm` - Removes the file from the file system and adds the removal to the index
    * This is important, because git will not automatically remove files that you delete.
  * `git mv` - Renames the file - equivalent to `mv file1 file2; git rm file1; git add file2`
    * Remember that git doesn't track file names in a blob, so moves are tricky

## Viewing git information

  * `git status` - Shows the status of the changed files
  * `git diff` - Shows the difference between two files, or the changes made to a file
  * `git log` - Shows the commit logs
  * `git blame` - Shows the author of every line in the file
  * `git bisect` - Search the git history for a specific commit

## Branching and merging

  * `git branch` - Create, show and delete branches
  * `git checkout` - Create and switch branches
  * `git merge` - Merge the changes from one branch into the current branch

## Making changes to the history

  * `git reset` - Restores the working copy to the most recent committed version
  * `git checkout` - Restores a single file in the working copy to the most recent committed version
  * `git commit` - Commits all the files in **index** into the repository
  * `git revert` - Undoes the most recent commit by adding a new commit, with all the changes reverted
  * `git cherry-pick` - Applies a single commit to your current branch
  * `git rebase` - Rewrite history

## Collaboration

  * `git clone` - Fetches a remote git repository and checks it out
  * `git fetch` - Fetches objects and reference from a remote repository
  * `git pull` - Fetches and merges objects and references from a remote repository
  * `git push` - Sends refs and remotes to a remote repository

!SLIDE

# Advanced Git

## Git hooks

  * Git allows you to customize behavior with hooks
    * Ensure that the code works before merging it
    * Deploy code elsewhere after a commit
    * Other actions that need to happen automatically

## The really gory details

This slide will be completed someday.

HAHAHAHA no.
