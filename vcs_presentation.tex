\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{What is VCS?}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item A Version Control System, or VCS, is a way to track changes to files
	\item Allows you to manage code or documents as you edit it
	\item Makes collaborating on a document/code significantly easier
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Why should you care?}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Track changes to your files over time
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Try out experimental ideas to code without risking and permanent harm
	    \item Use VCS on your homework to track your changes between drafts
	    \item Turn a VCS into a backup system!
	\end{itemize}
	\item Locate the revision that a bug was introduced
	\item Manage changes to a single file across multiple users
	\item VCS can prevent you from really buggering a project
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item ``Wait, you {\bf didn't} want that file deleted?''
	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Why should you care?}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Any sane developer/project uses VCS
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item sourceforge
	    \item code.google.com
	    \item github/gitorious/git.or.cz
	\end{itemize}
	\item The CAT utilized VCS in many locations
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item agendas - RCS
	    \item CRACK - Git
	    \item intranet - Git
	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Background}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Before VCS}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Living dangerously!
    \end{itemize}
    vim foo.txt \\
    \begin{itemize}
	\item {\em three hours later} \\
    \end{itemize}
    rm *.txt \\
    \ldots \\
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Whoops. \\
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Do it yourself VCS}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Users replicated VCS tools by doing everything by hand
    \end{itemize}
     vim foo.txt \\
     cp foo.txt foo.txt.1 \&\& vim foo.txt \\
     cp foo.txt.1 foo.txt.2 \&\& vim foo.txt \&\& cp foo.txt foo.txt.1 \&\& vim foo.txt \\
    \ldots
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Obviously, this is not a very fun idea
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{The beginning of VCS}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Initial idea of VCS came from engineering
	\item Engineers would create blueprints, and save earlier revisions
	\item If a version was not liked, it was trivial to roll back
	\item Revision control was also applied in business, law
	\item Any place where you may need to backtrack on a document, VCS will show up
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Concerns with VCS}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Any VCS has to deal with some basic concerns
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Merging changes
	    \item Locking files
	    \item Atomic commits
	\end{itemize}
	\item Each VCS handles these concerns differently
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Early VCS}

\subsection{SCCS}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Source Code Control System (SCCS)}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Arguably the first VCS system available
	\item Developed by Bell Labs in 1972
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item For some comparison, C was written in 1972 at Bell Labs as well
	\end{itemize}
	\item SCCS was the dominant VCS until the advent of RCS 
	\item Generally considered obsolete, and only mentioned for historical purposes
	\item Except for the storage method - still used today
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{RCS}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Revision Control System (RCS)}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Released in 1982
	\item Created as an evolution of SCCS
	\item Stored changes of files as a series of diffs
	\item Very popular, still used today
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Pros and Cons of RCS}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Advantages
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Dirt simple
	    \item Only need to know a few commands
	    \item Changesets stored as series of diffs, so easy to view
	    \item File locking and branching supported
	\end{itemize}
	\item Disadvantages
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Single files only
	    \item Cannot store entire projects
	    \item No security mechanisms - anyone can tamper with diffs
	    \item Branching sucks - everybody just locks the file
	    \begin{itemize}
		\item co -l agenda.dog
		\item vim agenda.dog
		\item ci -u agenda.dog
	    \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{``Modern'' VCS}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Modern VCS}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item While early VCS systems were an improvement, they were still lacking
	\item No real support for multiple users
	\item No support for project wide version control
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Make changes in foo.c and bar.c, and changes in one break the other
	    \item No way to look at both of the changes without black magic and/or shell scripts
	\end{itemize}
	\item Technologies started coming out to deal with this 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{CVS}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Concurrent Version Systems (CVS)}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Behold! Another evolution!
	\item CVS was the first client-server VCS
	\item Instead of just hacking on one file in a specific location, you check out a project
	\item Support for project wide VCS
	\item Support for multiple users simultaneously working on one project
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Pros and Cons of CVS}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Advantages
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item \ldots
	    \item I got nothing.
	\end{itemize}
    \item Disadvantages
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Where do we start?
	    \item No moving/renaming of directories
	    \item No versioning of symbolic links
	    \item No unicode
	    \item No atomic commits 
	    \begin{itemize}
		\item It'll commit enough changes to break everything!
	    \end{itemize}
	    \item CVS was used because it was the first, not because it was good.
	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{SVN}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Apache Subversion (SVN)}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Since CVS sucked so much, people wanted an alternative
	\item SVN was supposed to be CVS without the problems
	\item Widely adopted by the open source community
	\item
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Pros and Cons of SVN}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Advantages
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item The most widely used VCS today
	    \item Robust and battle tested
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Fully centralized - no offline work
	    \item Slow - network latency can increase time to work
	    \item Based on CVS
	\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
